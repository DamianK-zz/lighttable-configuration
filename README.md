# lighttable-configuration
My current Light Table editor configuration

This repo contains the modifications I made to the Light Table editor configuration so it suits my needs.
Feel free to use it as you wish. I make no warranty that it will work for you.

Currently user.behaviors file is changed. No other stuff. If you know how to make a script to auto-install
plugins please let me know so I can put it here.

Regards
Damian
